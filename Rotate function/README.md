1. Calculate the initial values of sum (sum of all elements in the array) and F0 (the value of F for k=0).
2. Use dynamic programming to calculate F for k=1 to n-1. For each k, update F by adding the sum of the array minus n times the last element A[n-i] (where i is the current k value).
3. Here's the algorithm in more detail:

4. Initialize sum, F0, and res to 0 and INT_MIN respectively.
5. Iterate over the array A to calculate the initial values of sum and F0.
6. Create an array dp to store the values of F for each k.
7. Calculate F for k=0 and store it in dp[0].
8. Update res to the maximum of res and dp[0].
9. Iterate over k from 1 to n-1:
10. Update dp[k] by adding dp[k-1] and subtracting n times the last element A[n-i].
11. Update res to the maximum of res and dp[k].
12. Return res.
